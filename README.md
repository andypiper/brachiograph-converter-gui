A desktop app for converting images to [BrachioGraph](https://www.brachiograph.art/) format.

tl;dr I wanted a GUI app for quickly converting images to draw with a BrachioGraph, I really liked [the one that Henry Triplette made](https://github.com/henrytriplette/python-brachiograph-gui), but then PySimpleGUI went to a paid model. After thinking about upgrading (or migrating to FreeSimpleGUI), I decided to write a new-but-similar thing using PySides / QT instead. That thing, is this thing.

This app uses the `linedraw.py` module for converting images to JSON for the BrachioGraph, [originally written by Lingdong Huang](https://github.com/LingDong-/linedraw).

## Install

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```sh
python brachiograph_converter_gui.py
```
